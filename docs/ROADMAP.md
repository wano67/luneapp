# ROADMAP

## P0 (replace accountant baseline)
- Deterministic pricing chain (catalog -> project service -> pricing -> quote -> invoice).
- Block quote creation if any service price is missing.
- Client Facturation hub (read-only summary + quotes/invoices).
- CRM core: clients/prospects edit + prospect conversion.
- Agenda follow-up list (light surface only).
- Accounting basics: invoice journal, paid vs outstanding, due dates.

## P1 (high value)
- Calendar UI (week/month) with tasks, interactions, invoice due dates.
- Project messaging threads + attachments.
- Basic exports (CSV) and accounting categories.
- VAT calculations on quotes/invoices.

## P2 (advanced)
- Bank reconciliation and statement import.
- FEC export and audit log.
- Automation for follow-up reminders.
- Fine-grained permissions and advanced notifications.
