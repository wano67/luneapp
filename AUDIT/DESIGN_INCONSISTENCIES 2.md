# Design Inconsistencies
- **Personal workspace uses legacy layouts, not the Pro shell**  
  - Evidence: `src/app/app/personal/page.tsx:1-78` is a client-only page with manual fetch/redirect and ad-hoc cards; no `AppShell`/`SectionHeader` usage.  
  - Impact: visual gap vs premium Pro shell (sidebar, headers), inconsistent navigation.
- **Performance dashboards likely stale**  
  - Evidence: `src/app/app/performance/page.tsx` and subpages (`alignement`, `perso`, `pro`) are zero-referenced (ROUTES_PAGES.csv) yet keep bespoke layouts; risk of outdated styles if surfaced.  
  - Impact: Dead or off-brand screens if linked; unnecessary bundle weight.
- **Mock-driven Pro dashboards**  
  - Evidence: `src/app/app/pro/ProHomeClient.tsx:1-120` imports mock data and hard-coded sections instead of shared SectionHeader/KPI components.  
  - Impact: Inconsistent data visuals vs live Pro pages; styling drifts from current tokens/cards.
- **Placeholder page exposed**  
  - Evidence: `src/pages/__placeholder__.tsx:1-3` returns null but is still a route; no design, breaks polish.  
  - Impact: Blank screen reachable via `/__placeholder__`, harms perceived quality.
